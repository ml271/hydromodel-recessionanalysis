# hydrological karst model: linear_stroage_model+soil_routine
For my ongoing master thesis I designed a lumped precipitation-discharge model to model karst spring discharge on a daily time step. The model consists of a soil-reservoir that is filled by a precipitation time series. When the reservoir reaches a given threshold (h_0) excess water will infiltrated in two parallel reservoirs. A portion (a) of the infiltrated water is directed in the slow reservoir and the other portion (1-a) flows in the fast reservoir. Those two parallel reservoirs represent water storage in the karst conduits and in the limestone aquifer matrix. Both reservoir have a linear storage-outflow-function but differ in their outflow parameters.
